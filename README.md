<h1> The Space Shooter User Manual </h1>
 <p> Space Shooter is a 2D action game designed using Unity. The main 
objective of the game is to skillfully dodge enemy shots and destroy them 
with using your own weapon! You earn points for each enemy you 
neutralize. You have three lives in the game. Use them wisely. Enjoy the view 
while fighting enemy ships.</p>
<h1>How to play?</h1>
The spacecraft is controlled with the “W, A, S, D” keys, similar to classic 
action games. Firing is activated by pressing the “SPACE” button.
Destroying enemy ships earns 100 points. Colliding with enemy ships or 
getting hit by their lasers deducts 1 life. If your life count reaches zero, the 
game ends. Every thirty seconds, the game's difficulty increases and the 
spawn rate of enemy ships rises, so you must be more careful
